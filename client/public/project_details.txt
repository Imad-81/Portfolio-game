TF_Converter.py for converting model formats (e.g., TensorFlow).
random.py miscellaneous utilities.
data/: CSV files with historical price data at various timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h) and test results data.
Balanced_Trades.csv: example output of balanced trades from evaluation.
test.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for interactive experimentation.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.10+ (or compatible environment)
Install dependencies as needed; most scripts rely on common packages such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, and xgboost.

# AI Humanizer

A robust automation pipeline designed to rewrite AI-generated text into a natural, academic, and professional human-like style. Optimized for use with local LLMs (like Mistral-7B) via LM Studio.

## Features

- **Human-Centric Rewriting:** Transforms robotic prose into text with natural human variation, rhythm, and tone.
- **Academic Precision:** Maintains a formal, professional tone suitable for academic and research contexts.
- **Content Integrity:** Strictly preserves all facts, numbers, dates, and technical terms.
- **Length Preservation:** Advanced logic in `main2.py` ensures the rewritten text maintains a similar length and sentence count to the original, preventing unwanted summarization.
- **Chunk-Based Processing:** Automatically handles long documents by splitting them into manageable chunks.
- **Detector Resistance:** Specifically designed to avoid common hallmarks of AI-generated content.
- **LM Studio Integration:** Connects seamlessly to LM Studio's local API.

## Available Pipelines

### 1. Standard LLM Pipeline (`main.py`)
The primary automation script using LLM rewrites via LM Studio. Focuses on high-quality humanization and academic tone.

### 2. Length-Preserving LLM Pipeline (`main2.py`)
An enhanced version of the standard pipeline that adds strict length and sentence count preservation. Highly recommended for maintaining document structure.

### 3. Rule-Based Transformer (`pra_transform.py`)
A fast, non-LLM alternative that introduces human-like "imperfections" (subtle typos, fillers, comma variations) using rule-based transformations. Useful for quick processing or as a baseline.

## Project Structure

- `main.py` / `main2.py`: The LLM automation pipelines.
- `pra_transform.py`: Rule-based transformation script.
- `/inputs`: Place your `.txt` files here for processing.
- `/outputs`: Humanized files are saved here.
- `/failed`: Files that require manual review are moved here if validation fails.
- `humanizer_log.txt`: Detailed logs of the humanization process.

## Setup

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    - Python 3.9+
    - [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) running with a compatible model (e.g., Mistral-7B Instruct).

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install requests regex nltk textstat
    ```

3.  **Configuration:**
    Update `LMSTUDIO_API_URL` and `MODEL` in `main.py` or `main2.py` if your local setup differs from the defaults:
    ```python
    LMSTUDIO_API_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:11434"
    MODEL = "mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.3"
    ```

## Usage

1.  Place text files in the `inputs/` directory.
2.  Run your preferred pipeline:
    ```bash
    python main2.py
    ```
3.  Check the `outputs/` directory for the results.

## Requirements

- `requests`
- `regex`
- `nltk` (optional, fallback included)
- `textstat` (for readability metrics)
